# Python LLM API (Task)
---
## Summary

This codes simulates a script that will:
1. Read a document
2. Preprocess the text 
3. Split the text into paragraphs
4. Send each paragraph to an API which will summarize the text using an LLM
5. Save a JSON document which contains the original text of each paragraph plus the summary generated by the LLM and the time it took to generate the summary

NOTE: Currently the LLM API is not yet implemented and will be simulated using
a simple function that returns the same text with the words in reverse order.

---
### Minumum requirement for the script to run is `python 3`
---

### To run the script:

`python extract_requirements.py <filepath>`

There is an example text which can be used called `regulations.txt`

Unit tests are also available by running: 

`python text.py`
